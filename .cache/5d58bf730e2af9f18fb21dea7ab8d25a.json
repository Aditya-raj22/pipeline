ABL103 strongly inhibits\r\n                tumor growth and induces immunological memory to create prolonged anti-tumor protection. Structure and Mechanism of Action B7-H4 Dependent 4-1BB Activation ABL103 induces more significant cell lysis than Urelumab with B7-H4 dependent 4-1BB activation Superior Anti-Tumor Effect with Immunological Memory ABL103 Completely eliminates tumors in advanced tumor model and protects mice from re-challenge with MC38-B7-H4 tumor ABL Bio About Us Who We Are History Corporate Identity Leadership Contact Us ESG Platform & Strategies Platform Oncology Strategy CNS Disease Strategy ADC Strategy Publications Pipeline Overview ABL301 ABL503 ABL111 ABL102 ABL103 ABL104 ABL105 Investors & Media Public Disclosure Stock Information Finance Information Notice News Document & Materials Careers Core Competencies Benefits Recruitment Recruiting Process \uba54\ub274\ub2eb\uae30", "type": "text"}
