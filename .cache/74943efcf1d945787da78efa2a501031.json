ABL001 can be developed as  the next generation of anti-angiogenic therapy. \ub2eb\uae30 ABL105 Pipeline ABL105 Program Target HER2x4-1BB Disease Indication Solid Tumor Development Stage Clinical Development (Phase 1) Summary ABL105 is a bispecific antibody that simultaneously HER2 and 4-1BB, crosslinking and activating 4-1BB signaling only in the presence of HER2\r\n                    expressing tumor cells. Additionally, ABL105 blocks HER2 signaling and induces NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, leading to stronger anti-tumor activity.\r\n                    ABL105 significantly inhibits tumor growth and protects mice from tumor recurrence by inducing tumor-specific immunological memory. more \ub2eb\uae30 ABL111 Pipeline ABL111 (Givastomig) Program Target Claudin18.2x4-1BB Disease Indication Solid Tumor Development Stage Clinical Development (Phase 1) Summary ABL111 is a bispecific antibody that targets Claudin18.2, a tumor antigen overexpressed in\r\n                    gastric- and pancreatic-specific cancer, and 4-1BB, a co-stimulatory receptor with the ability to\r\n                    induce potent anti-tumor activity. To minimize the usual toxicity associated with monospecific\r\n                    4-1BB based treatments, ABL111 only activates the 4-1BB pathway when engaged with Claudin\r\n                    18.2, thus triggering T cell activation and enhancing anti-tumor immunity while minimizing\r\n                    toxicity. ABL111 shows superior anti-tumor activity in an animal model system compared to\r\n                    Claudin18.2 alone, 4-1BB alone, and the combination of both Claudin18.2 and 4-1BB, with\r\n                    immunological memory resistant to any possible recurrence of the cancer cells. more \ub2eb\uae30 ABL301 Pipeline ABL301 SAR446159 Program Target SNCA x IGF1R Disease Indication Parkinson\u2019s Disease Development Stage IND enabling study Summary The propagation of aggregated forms of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-synuclein, SNCA) appears to be critical for the etiology of Parkinson\u2019s disease and multiple system atrophy. ABL301 selectively targets aggregated forms of \u03b1-synuclein as a potential disease target, avoiding its normal, monomeric form. Since poor delivery of antibodies pastsing the blood-brain-barrier is thought to be one of the major obstacles for CNS-related drug development, ABL301 has a shuttle antibody(IGF1R antibodyL Grabody B) that allows for improved delivery of antibody therapeutics into the brain. This dual mechanism will enable antibody therapeutics to more efficiently reach their targets, leading to better therapeutic efficacy compared to conventional monoclonal antibodies. more \ub2eb\uae30 ABL501 Pipeline ABL501 Program Target PD-L1 x LAG-3 Disease Indication Solid Tumor Development Stage Clinical Development (Phase 1) Summary ABL501 is a bispecific antibody capable of blocking the PD-L1 and LAG-3 immune checkpoint\r\n                    pathways, overcoming the current limitations of conventional PD-(L)1 therapy based around\r\n                    resistance to PD-L1 and low response rates. ABL501 demonstrates a higher efficacy over\r\n                    LAG-3 alone, PD-L1 alone, and the combination of LAG-3 and PD-L1, and shows superior\r\n                    performance compared to competing substances. more \ub2eb\uae30 ABL503 Pipeline ABL503 (Ragistomig) Program Target PD-L1 x 4-1BB Disease Indication Solid Tumor Development Stage Clinical Development (Phase 1) Summary ABL503 is a bispecific antibody that combines the capabilities of PD-L1 checkpoint pathway\r\n                    inhibiton with 4-1BB agonistic activity to overcome the specific limitations of PD-(L)1\r\n                    immunotherapy and 4-1BB related toxicity. ABL503 is uniquely designed to only induce 4-1BB\r\n                    signalling when simultaneously binded to the PD-L1 tumor antigen on cancer cells, limiting the\r\n                    toxicity characteristic of traditional 4-1BB based treatment while augmenting T-cell activation.\r\n                    ABL503 shows superior anti-tumor activity in an animal model system compared to PD-L1\r\n                    alone, 4-1BB alone, and the combination of PD-L1 and 4-1BB, with immunological memory\r\n                    resistant to any possible recurrence of the tumor. more \ub2eb\uae30 ABL101 Pipeline ABL101 Program Target BCMAx4-1BB Disease Indication Hematologic Cancer Development Stage IND enabling study Summary A novel T-cell engaging bispecific antibody, ABL101 demonstrates a robust anti-tumor effect via\r\n                    BCMA mediated 4-1BB activation in tumor microenvironments (TME). ABL101 only activates\r\n                    4-1BB signaling pathways in the presence of BCMA expressing cancer cells, minimizing the\r\n                    probability of hepatotoxicity in healthy tissues. ABL101 inhibits tumor growth and, by retaining\r\n                    immunological memory, induces a prolonged anti-tumor effect. more \ub2eb\uae30 ABL103 Pipeline ABL103 Program Target B7-H4x4-1BB Disease Indication Solid Cancer Development Stage IND enabling study Summary A novel T-cell engaging bispecific antibody, ABL103 demonstrates efficacious anti-tumor activity\r\n                    via B7-H4 mediated 4-1BB activation in tumor microenvironments (TME), only activating 4-1BB\r\n                    signaling pathways when in the presence of B7-H4 expressing cells. ABL103 strongly inhibits\r\n                    tumor growth and induces immunological memory to create prolonged anti-tumor protection. more \ub2eb\uae30 ABL102 Pipeline ABL102 Program Target ROR1x4-1BB Disease Indication Solid & Blood  Tumor Development Stage IND enabling study Summary ABL102 is a bispecific antibody that simultaneously targets ROR1 and 4-1BB, activating 4-1BB signaling only in the presence of ROR1 expressing tumor\r\n                    cells. By having intact Fc, ABL102 activates T cells via FcgRI mediated 4-1BB clustering. Additionally, ABL102 induces intra-tumoral Treg depletion potentially\r\n                    via an ADCC activity, resulting in strong tumor growth inbihition. ABL102 significantly inhibits tumor growth and protects mice from tumor recurrence inducing\r\n                    tumor-specific immunological memory. more \ub2eb\uae30 ABL104 Pipeline ABL104 Program Target EGFRx4-1BB Disease Indication Solid Tumor Development Stage IND enabling study Summary ABL104 is a bispecific antibody that simultaneously targets EGFR and 4-1BB, crosslinking and activating 4-1BB signaling only in the presence of\r\n                    EGFR-expressing tumor cells. Additionally, ABL104 induces stronger antitumor activity by blocking EGFR signaling. ABL104 significantly inhibits\r\n                    tumor growth and portects mice from tumor recurrence by inducing tumor-specific immunological memory. more \ub2eb\uae30 ABL602 Pipeline ABL602 Program Target CLL1xCD3 Disease Indication Blood Cancer Development Stage IND enabling study Summary ABL602 is a head-to-tail 2+1 bispecific T cell engager targeting CLL1. ABL602 binds weakly to CD3 in normal tissue, but its binding is greatly potentiated\r\n                    in tumor microenvironments (TME). ABL602 exhibits anti-tumor activity via CLL1 mediated T cell activation and does not induces cytokines in the\r\n                    absence of CLL1. ABL602 is expected to be a safer and more effective therapy for AML. more \ub2eb\uae30 ABL Bio About Us Who We Are History Corporate Identity Leadership Contact Us ESG Platform & Strategies Platform Oncology Strategy CNS Disease Strategy ADC Strategy Publications Pipeline Overview ABL301 ABL503 ABL111 ABL102 ABL103 ABL104 ABL105 Investors & Media Public Disclosure Stock Information Finance Information Notice News Document & Materials Careers Core Competencies Benefits Recruitment Recruiting Process \uba54\ub274\ub2eb\uae30", "type": "text"}
