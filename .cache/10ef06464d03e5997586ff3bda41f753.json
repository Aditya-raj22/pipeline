It binds to TIE2 expressing endothelial cells and normalize VEGF-induced pathological leaky blood vessels in eyes and TME (tumor microenvironment). Status PMC-403 was tested in various vessel-related diseases, such as AMD (Age-related Macular Degeneration), DR (Diabetic Retinopathy), and even solid tumors. In these models, significant vessel normalizing effects were found which suggest versatile use in a wide range of indications. PharmAbcine initiated the GLP-tox study of PMC-403 in 2Q21 and expects an IND filing for eye diseases in 3Q22.
