Daejeon, South Korea, January 8th, 2025 /- PharmAbcine , Inc. (KOSDAQ: 208340), a clinical-stage public company developing next-generation IgG-based therapeutics to address unmet medical needs, announced today that its novel TIE2-activating antibody, PMC-403 , has received unanimous safety approval from the Safety Review Committee (SRC) for the 3mg multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohort in its Phase 1 clinical trial for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). In parallel, the company is recruiting patients for the 4mg multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohort and 6mg single ascending dose (SAD). PMC-403 is a novel TIE2-activating antibody with a unique mechanism that stabilizes pathological, leaky, inflamed blood vessels. TIE2 receptors, expressed on endothelial cells, play a pivotal role in the homeostasis of both blood vessels and lymphatic vessels. This Phase 1 trial targets patients with neovascular AMD who are no longer responding to anti-VEGF standard therapeutics. The safety and tolerability of the 3mg multiple dose were successfully confirmed. Dr. Weon Sup Lee, Head of R&D and Chief Technology Officer at PharmAbcine, stated, \"The successful completion of the 3mg multiple-dose study is a significant milestone, highlighting the potential of PMC-403 as a breakthrough treatment for nAMD. As the 4mg MAD and 6mg SAD cohorts are ongoing in parallel, we aim to gather additional safety and efficacy data to establish a robust foundation for Phase 2 trials.\" Macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness, results from aging-related damage to the retina, particularly due to the development of abnormal blood vessels in the macula. The global aging population has led to a rapid increase in cases, and current standard treatments with anti-VEGF inhibitors are often insufficient for complete treatment. Consequently, there is a growing demand for therapies with novel mechanisms of action. PharmAbcine plans to continue its research, with the goal of initiating a Phase 2 trial after confirming the safety and efficacy of the 4mg multiple-dose cohort and 6mg single-dose cohort. The company expects PMC-403 to play a pivotal role in the global market for AMD treatments. Beyond ophthalmology, PMC-403 is being explored in therapeutic areas including vascular-related rare diseases and kidney diseases. The company has conducted a research collaboration with Dr. Kirk Druey, former Chief of the NIH's Lung and Vascular Inflammation Section, to explore the efficacy of PMC-403 in animal models for a rare disease called systemic capillary leak syndrome (SCLS, also known as Clarkson disease). In a recent interview, Dr. Druey expressed excitement about PMC-403 \u2019s potential in treating patients with SCLS. While there is currently no treatment for SCLS, PMC-403 received Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of SCLS on February 21st, 2023.

PharmAbcine is a clinical-stage public company developing next-generation IgG-based therapeutics to treat cancer, neovascular eye diseases, and vascular-related unmet needs. The Company\u2019s main pipeline includes clinical assets olinvacimab, PMC-403, and PMC-309. Olinvacimab, the Company\u2019s lead asset, is ongoing a Phase II trial in combination with MSD\u2019s pembrolizumab for mTNBC patients in Australia to reconfirm the encouraging results from the Phase Ib olinvacimab plus pembrolizumab trial, delivering 50% ORR, 67% DCR, and a clean safety profile. PMC-403 is a novel TIE2-activating antibody that stabilizes dysfunctional, leaky, disorganized pathological vessels and can be used for vascular-related eye disease, including wet AMD (Age-related Macular Degeneration). PMC-403 is currently undergoing a Phase 1 trial for neovascular AMD patients in Korea. PMC-403 is also being explored to expand into wider therapeutic areas related to pathological vessels, including vessel-related rare diseases and non-rare diseases. PMC-309, a novel anti-VISTA-antagonizing IgG in pan-pH conditions, is an immune checkpoint regulator that targets MDSC (myeloid-derived suppressor cells) and M2 macrophages, which play a pivotal role in maintaining an immunosuppressive TME (Tumor Microenvironment). Phase I is ongoing at multicenters in Australia, and Phase Ib/II in combination with MSD\u2019s pembrolizumab (PMC-309 + pembrolizumab combo) is planned. PMC-005 is an anti-EGFRviii IgG that only binds to EGFRviii expressed on cancer cells and can be applied to various modalities, including CAR-T, CAR-NK, CAR-Macrophage, T cell/NK cell engagers, and Radio-Immunotherapy.
