The therapeutics is expected to have high commercial value as it demonstrates long-term efficacy while minimizing side effects of existing drugs such as sexual dysfunction and restricted use on women. Target RNA: Androgen Receptor (AR) Administration Route: Intradermal Injection Androgenic Alopecia (AGA) Androgenic alopecia results from male hormone response. Testosterone is converted into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by 5-alpha reductase, and its binding with androgen receptors leads to reduced follicles to change in the hair growth cycle, ultimately causing hair growth to cease. Preclinical Data Development Status Efficient inhibition of AGA identified in animal models and hair follicles Patent granted (US, Japan, Korea) Selected as national innovative drug development project (KDDF) Phase 1a clinical trial completed (AU) Title Link A Multi-Centre, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Single Ascending Dose Phase 1 Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of OLX72021 in Healthy Males with Androgenetic Alopecia.
