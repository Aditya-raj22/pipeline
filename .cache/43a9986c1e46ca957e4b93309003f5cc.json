ABL501 demonstrates a higher efficacy over\r\n                LAG-3 alone, PD-L1 alone, and the combination of LAG-3 and PD-L1, and shows superior\r\n                performance compared to competing substances. Mechanism of action ABL501 is a bispecific antibody targeting LAG-3 and PD-L1 and blocks the interaction of LAG3-MHCII and PD-1-PD-L1, releasing T cells from tumor-mediated suppression Higher T cell activation than combination of LAG-3 and PD-L1 antibodies ABL501 induced superior T cell activation compared to the combination of LAG-3 and PD-L1\r\n            antibodies as indicated in PBMC-based IL-2 expression assays and dual blockade reporter\r\n            assays Strong tumor killing effect of ABL501 compared with Atezolizumab ABL501 induced stronger cytotoxic activity on NSCLC cells in the presence of tumor-matched patient PBMCs Potent inhibition on tumor progression ABL501 exhibited dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition Phase 1 clinical study Monotherapy dose escalation is ongoing with support of Korea Drug Development Fund funded by Ministry of Science and ICT, Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy, and Ministry of Health and Welfare (HN21C0979000021, Republic of Korea).
