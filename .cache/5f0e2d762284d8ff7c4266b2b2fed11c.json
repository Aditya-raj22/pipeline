ABL301 selectively targets aggregated forms of \u03b1-synuclein as a potential disease target, avoiding its normal, monomeric form. Since poor delivery of antibodies pastsing the blood-brain-barrier is thought to be one of the major obstacles for CNS-related drug development, ABL301 has a shuttle antibody(IGF1R antibodyL Grabody B) that allows for improved delivery of antibody therapeutics into the brain. This dual mechanism will enable antibody therapeutics to more efficiently reach their targets, leading to better therapeutic efficacy compared to conventional monoclonal antibodies.
