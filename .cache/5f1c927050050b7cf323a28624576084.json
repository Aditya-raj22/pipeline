It indirectly promotes T cells' immune responses by inhibiting VISTA-expressing immunosuppressive cells, such as MDSCs (Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells) and M1 macrophages, and Tregs that \u00a0suppress T cell activation and proliferation. Status The molecule's mechanism and preclinical efficacies have been confirmed in both in vitro and in vivo models. PharmAbcine initiated the GLP-tox study of PMC-309 in 2Q21 and expects an IND filing in 2Q22.
