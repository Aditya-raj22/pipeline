In addition to improving the fatty liver, hepatic steatosis, and fibrosis, OliX is expanding the drug indication to obesity. MASH is the most common liver disease worldwide with no treatment, giving it promising market potential. * GWAS: This is a study analyzing the correlation between the specific disease and the nucleic sequence, conducted on a large-scale population of 450,000 individuals. It provides statistically significant genetic data. Target RNA: Undisclosed Administration Route: Subcutaneous Injection Metabolic Dysfunction-associated Steatohepatitis (MASH) MASH is a liver condition characterized by the accumulation of liver fat, inflammation, and hepatocellular damage, regardless of heavy alcohol use. If left untreated, the condition can aggravate to cause fibrosis, cirrhosis, and even liver cancer. MASH often coexists with other metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. While liver fibrosis was considered irreversible, recent studies suggest that robust therapeutics may revert fibrous tissues to normal.
