It blocks the binding of all VEGFR ligands such as VEGF-A, VEGF-C and VEGF-D to VEGFR2. To gain nutrients and oxygen needed for growth, tumor cells release these VEGF ligands which promote angiogenesis (a formation of new blood vessels) that will enhance tumor blood supply. Binding of olinvacimab to VEGFR2 will result in the inhibition of VEGF-mediated tumor angiogenesis. Development Status PharmAbcine has multiple ongoing global clinical trials involving Olinvacimab. Other than the ongoing Phase 2a Olinvacimab and Pembrolizumab combo trial in mTNBC, which had the first patient dosed in December 2021, a Phase 2a Olinvacimab mono study for Bevacizumab-nonresponding rGBM (recurrent glioblastoma multiforme) patients is ongoing at multiple sites in both US and Australia. The Olinvacimab and Pembrolizumab combo treatments in two Phase 1b studies for both mTNBC and rGBM are finished. There are some patients in the mTNBC and rGBM studies who are receiving Olinvacimab monotherapy as compassionate use per requests from patients, families, and PIs. PharmAbcine expects the final clinical reports of the two phase 1b trials to be available in 3Q22.
