ABL101 only activates\r\n                4-1BB signaling pathways in the presence of BCMA expressing cancer cells, minimizing the\r\n                probability of hepatotoxicity in healthy tissues. ABL101 inhibits tumor growth and, by retaining\r\n                immunological memory, induces a prolonged anti-tumor effect.
