How Do Licenses Work? The primary function of a report license is to define how many people within a company are authorized to use the purchased report. This is separate to how a report might be delivered.  Unless specifically identified otherwise, the purchase option is Single User.  Below is a helpful description of that license, along with a sampling of others most commonly offered. Single User License This license allows only one user to have access to and to use/read the report. It is not one user at a time or one user group; it is an individual who will be reading and utilizing the report. Global Site License This license allows for the entire purchasing company to read and use the report. This is the license level that would allow for a report to be placed on an internal  company shared drive for access by all employees of that direct company. This license does not extend to parent or sister company use. Departmental License This license is designed to allow an entire department within a company full access to a report. The departmental license is a great option for companies that have more than one location and the department is spread out all over the country/world Site License This license is for companies that have one location where they want the report to be accessible by all employees within that physical location. Multi-User License This is the most flexible of the licensing options. Some publishers will allow you to get a license for a preset number of people (typically 5).  These licenses are ideal for small work groups. License options are at the discretion of each publisher.  As such, not all licenses indicated above are available for every product.
