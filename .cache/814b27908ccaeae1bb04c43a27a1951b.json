The program targets a gene that plays a major role in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell damage. Currently, there are no approved therapies to treat patients with both geographic atrophy (GA) and wet AMD, and one drug approved for GA is with concern regarding its efficacy. OLX301A has the potential to be a novel drug for wet AMD patients who is not responsive to conventional VEGF therapies. Target RNA: Undisclosed Administration Route: Intravitreal Injection Age-related Macular Degeneration(AMD) AMD is a degenerative disease that causes abnormalities in the central part of the retina, leading to vision loss. The disease usually comes with age. When retina cells start to lose their function, metabolic wastes accumulate, impairing the choroidal blood supply function and eventually leading to cellular atrophy/choroidal neovascularization (CNV). While earlier stages of the disease (including the GA stage without CNV) are categorized as dry AMD, later-stage AMD with vascular leakage is classified as wet AMD.
