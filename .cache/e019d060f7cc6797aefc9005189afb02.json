Unlike conventional surgical treatments which are not involved in scar formation mechanisms, OLX101 directly inhibits collagen production by targeting CTGF mRNA. Target RNA: CTGF Administration Route: Intradermal Injection Hypertrophic Scar/Keloids CTGF is a major factor in fibrotic diseases which promotes the production of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, including collagen. Often, abnormal response (production of extra collagen fibers due to overexpression of CTGF) during the wound healing process leads to the formation of hypertrophic scars/keloids.
